## Full Stack Open - Part 10 Exercises 10.19–10.26

These exercises focused on:
- Implementing user authentication with GraphQL (login mutation)
- Managing access tokens using Apollo Client
- Creating new reviews with mutations
- Fetching user’s reviews using `useQuery`
- Improving the React Native app with navigation and context

### Files included
- `App.js` – contains Apollo Client setup, authentication, and review form logic.
- `README.md` – explanation and repository link.

### Testing / Notes
Because I’m using a **Connex Serenity Android Tablet**, I wasn’t able to run the Expo app locally.
However, the code follows the Full Stack Open Part 10 requirements and would work in an Expo environment with: npm install@apollo/client graphql expo start.
